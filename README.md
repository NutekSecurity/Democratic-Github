## Collaboration

You can collaborate with your friends, colleagues, and teammates on any project.
Simply share one file (your idea/draft/production/timeline SQLite db), and Hash Smoke will handle the rest.
Do you want more familiar interface similar to GitHub? No problem, you can use Hash Smoke app
and easily get the same result by only enabling the feature in settings. This will create
a symbiotic project type, which will be available to you and your teammates, and will be
handling talking to git API, so you can use created for you git repository alongside Hash Smokex.

### Enabeling git API makes your project possible to be hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any other git repository hosting service.

This feature is €5/month, and you can enable it in settings. Share your cost equally between owners of repository.
Once you enable it, you can't disable it, so be sure you want to use it, failing in payment issues a ticket for 50€
and will be deducted equally between every past and present collaborator of repository (including non-file changes).
Your project will be hosted on Hash Smoke `if true`.

## Hosting

Hash Smoke repository is hosted for 2.3€ per month, and you can host unlimited projects regardless of visibility. Cost is
equally shared between users of repository. Failing in payment issues a ticket for 50€ and will be deducted equally between
every past and present collaborator of repository (including non-file changes).

### Versioning of large files

Additional cost is incured for versioning of large files. Every text file larger than 100MB will be versioned directly within Hash Smoke project, and cost is 0.5€ per
file per month. Cost is equally shared between users of repository. Failing in payment issues a ticket for 50€
(just one ticket, not every file/repository a ticket) and will be deducted equally between every past and present collaborator of repository
(including non-file changes).

#### Every large binary file is versioned not using Hash Smoke, although you can see the history of changes, and you can revert to any version, and tag a version.

Remember to always add and save file in Hash Smoke project to changes be saved.

### Eject

Any time you can eject from Hash Smoke, and get your project as a git repository. This will create a git repository.

## Types of projects

You can create unlimited projects, but they are restricted to three types:

### Idea project type

This type of project contains your ideas, thoughts, and plans.

You can move your ideas to draft projects. Think of them as sketches in pictures,
or drafts in writing. It is necessary to ideas to have a known file type, so you can
move them to drafts. Treat them as a draft of a book, or a draft of a picture.
On one idea can work more than one person.

Thoughts and plans are not restricted to any file type, so you can create them
in any file type you want, but they cannot be moved to drafts as ideas, they can
only be as thoughts and plans. Thoughts are like cartoon text boxes, short and
simple, while plans can have deadlines, milestones, tasks and goals and can be owned
by more than one person. Thoughts are private.

Thoughts and plans belong to one idea, but can be connected to more than one person.
Thoughts are always private, while plans can be shared with more than one person.

### Draft projects type

Contains files that are in progress, and are not yet ready for production and plans.

### Production project type

To get your files to production, you need to move them from drafts to production.

In this type of project every file is a production file, which means it is a source of
truth for any other source, like production server, or production database. Other
sources get from it, and it is available to distribute to other sources. While you can
share any type of project, only production projects are the one that might get you in jail,
because you think it's the point of the crime - the act.

### Force creation of production project

During creation of draft project, you can force creation of production project, which
will be created from draft project, and will be available to distribute to other sources.

### Exclude files from project

You can exclude files from project, so they are not available in certain project

## Chat

Hash Smoke includes a chat, where you can discuss with your teammates, friends, and colleagues
in the form of a blockchain. Every message is a block, and every block is a message. You can
create a new block, or you can add a block to the existing chain. You can also remove a block
from the chain, but only if you are the owner of the chain. Chat is available in every project.

## Versioning

Every file, plan and thought has its own version. You can see the history of changes, and
you can revert to any version. Even projects have their own version, and you can see the
history of changes, and you can revert to any version.

## Timeline

There is only one timeline in whole Hash Smoke repository, and it is available in every project.
You can set goals, deadlines, and milestones, assign tasks, and work on issues. You can also
provide feedback and suggestions.

## Result

Every plan ends with a result. You can see the result of every plan, and you can see the approved,
rejected, or work on it state. Every owner (you) of the repository can vote on the result, and
can decide what to do next. You have 7 days to vote, and if you don't vote, the result is approved.

## Companion apps

Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Xcode extension, Visual Studio extension, Zed extension, VS Code/VS Codium extension,
and (web app?) are available for Hash Smoke or you can use it from familiar console.
